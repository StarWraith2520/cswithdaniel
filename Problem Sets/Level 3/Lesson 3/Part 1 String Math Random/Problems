1. Identify all statements below that produce errors. Determine the output when those statements are removed.

System.out.println("abcdefg".length());
System.out.println("abcdabcd".indexOf("bcd"));
System.out.println("abcdabcd".indexOf("cde"));
System.out.println("abcdefg".charAt(3));
"abcdefg".charAt(7);
"abcdefg".charAt(-1);
System.out.println("abcdefg".substring(3));
System.out.println("abcdefg".substring(7));
"abcdefg".substring(8);
"abcdefg".substring(-1);
System.out.println("abcdefg".substring(4, 6));
System.out.println("abcdefg".substring(3, 7));
System.out.println("abcdefg".substring(2, 2));
"abcdefg".substring(4, 8);
"abcdefg".substring(5, 4);


2. Evaluate the following using methods from the Java Math class (mathematically, ^ means exponent):
(sqrt(10) - 3)(4 + 7) / 4^2
e^(-(5.5 - 3.2)^2)
|2 - 5| / pi


3.
  a. Print a random integer from 0 to 5 excluding 5.
  b. Print a random integer from 3 to 7 excluding 7.
  c. Print a random odd integer from 7 to 17 inclusive.
  
  
4. You have a circular board game that has 10 squares on it.
You are going to roll a fair die and move your playing piece that many squares forward on the board.
You will keep rolling the die and moving your piece until you stop on every square.
Write a Java program which simulates the game.
(Hint: Create an array of size 10 to record the if the die stops at a square)
