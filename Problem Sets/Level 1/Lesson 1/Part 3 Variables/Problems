1.
  a. What is the difference between declaring and initializing a variable?
  Initializing a variable gives it a value, while declaring doesn't.
  b. Can you declare a variable without initializing it?
  Yes
  c. Can you initialize a variable without declaring it?
  No
  d. Can you print a variable without initializing it?
  No

2.
  a. List all 8 primitive data types.
  int, boolean, char, byte, long, short, double, float
  b. Identify the primitive data types that store integers only. List them in increasing order of memory size.
  byte, short, int, long
  c. Identify the primitive data types that store numbers including non-integers.
     Which one has more precision and takes up more memory space?
     double and float.
     (double has more precision and takes up more space)
  d. What do the remaining primitive data types store?
  boolean - true or false
  char - a single character
  
3. Explain everything that is wrong with the following code:
int i;
System.out.println(i);
int i = 5;
j = 7;
System.out.println(k);

Problems:
i is not initialized before it is printed (it is initialized after it is printed, which is wrong).
i is declared twice. //(i is declared twice (int i; and int i = 5;). If you want to initialize it without declaring it then do i = 5;)
j is not declared (is given a value before it is declared)
k doesn't even exist.

4. Use the following variables to print "5false8"
int i = 5;
boolean j = false;
int k = 2;
long l = 6;

System.out.println("" + i + j + (k + l));

5. Determine the output:
int i = 1;
int j = 2;
int k = 3;
System.out.println(i + "abc" + j + k);
System.out.println(i + "abc" + (j + k));

Output:
1abc23
1abc5

6. Determine the output:
int i = 9;
int j = 2;
i %= j;
System.out.println("" + i + j);

Output:
12

7. Determine the output:
  a. int q = 3;
     System.out.println(q++);
  Output:
  3
  b. int q = 3;
     System.out.println(++q);
  Output:
  4

8.
  a. Determine the output:
  double d1 = 5.7;
  double d2 = 9.5;
  d1 = d2;
  d2 = d1;
  System.out.println(d1 + " " + d2);
  
  b. Did the code successfully swap the variables? If not, fix the code to make it swap the variables. 
  No, the code did not successfully swap the variables.
  
  Fixed code:
  double d1 = 5.7;
  double d2 = 9.5;
  double temp = d1;
  d1 = d2;
  d2 = temp;
  System.out.println(d1 + " " + d2);
