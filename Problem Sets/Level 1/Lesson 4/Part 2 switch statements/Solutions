Output:

Notes:
When u is 0, "d" is printed.
When u is 1, "a", "b", and "c" are printed.
When u is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, "d" is printed.
When u is 7, "b" and "c" are printed.
When u is 8, "d" is printed.
When u is 9, "c" is printed.

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    switch (3 * i)
    {
        case -3: i = 1; break;
        case 0: i = -1;
        case 2: i = -2;
        case 3: System.out.println(i); break;
        case 6: System.out.println(3 + i);
        default: System.out.println(i * i);
    }
}

Output:
-2
5
4
9
16

Notes:
When i is 0, 0 is passed into the switch, and i = -1. Then, i = -2. Then, -2 is printed, and the switch is broken. The loop then uses i++ to make i -1.
When i is -1, -3 is passed into the switch, and i = 1. Then, the switch is broken, and the loop uses i++ to make i 2.
When i is 2, 6 is passed into the switch, and i + 3, which is 5, is printed. Then, i * i, which is 4, is printed. The loop then uses i++ to make i 3.
When i is 3, 9 is passed into the switch, and i * i, which is 9, is printed. Then, the loop uses i++ to make i 4.
When i is 4, 12 is passed into the switch, and i * i, which is 16, is printed. Then, the loop uses i++ to make i 5.
When i is 5, i < 5 is false so the loop ends.


5.
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    switch (3 * i)
    {
        case 0: i = -1;
        case 2: i = -2;
        case 3: System.out.println(i); break;
        case 6: System.out.println(3 + i);
        default: System.out.println(i * i);
    }
}

Initially, i = 0, and 3 * i, which is 0, is passed into the switch.
Then, i = -1. In the next case (since there is no break), i = -2. Then, -2 is printed, and the switch is broken.
The loop then uses i++ to make i 0, which is the same state as the start of the loop.
As a result, the loop will execute indefinitely until the program is terminated.
The program will repeatedly print -2 until it is terminated.
